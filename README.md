# Go-Game-Streaming-WebApp

This project is a part of the engineering curriculum in the french engineering school IMT Atlantique (Brest), specifically "UE Projet Commande Entreprise".

 The Go-Game-Streaming-WebApp is a web app dedicated to filming, detecting, streaming and digitizing a Go game.

 The goal was to build a robust detection algorithm to detect stones on a Go board during a live stream and assign them to their positions with the highest possible accuracy. 
 
 The app can be launched by running main.py.
